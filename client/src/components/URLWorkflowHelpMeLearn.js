        The URL Workflow is an automated vulnerability testing system that takes the highest-value web applications 
        discovered during Company and Wildcard workflows and performs comprehensive security testing.

        Think of it as your personal security tester that:
        ‚Ä¢ Selects the most important URLs based on ROI (Return on Investment)
        ‚Ä¢ Maps the attack surface of web applications
        ‚Ä¢ Runs automated vulnerability scans
        ‚Ä¢ Tests for common security issues like XSS, SQL injection, and more
        ‚Ä¢ Collects evidence and generates reproduction instructions

        This workflow transforms manual security testing into an automated, systematic process.

      title: "How Does the URL Workflow Work?",
      content: `
        The URL Workflow operates in four distinct phases:

        **Phase 1: Attack Surface Mapping**
        ‚Ä¢ Web crawling to discover all endpoints
        ‚Ä¢ Directory brute-forcing to find hidden paths
        ‚Ä¢ JavaScript analysis to extract API endpoints
        ‚Ä¢ HTTP method enumeration

        **Phase 2: DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)**
        ‚Ä¢ Nuclei template scanning for known vulnerabilities
        ‚Ä¢ Custom vulnerability tests
        ‚Ä¢ Browser-based validation for complex issues

        **Phase 3: Targeted Vulnerability Testing**
        ‚Ä¢ SQL injection testing
        ‚Ä¢ Cross-site scripting (XSS) detection
        ‚Ä¢ IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference) testing
        ‚Ä¢ Server-side request forgery (SSRF) detection
        ‚Ä¢ Authentication bypass attempts

        **Phase 4: Evidence Collection**
        ‚Ä¢ Screenshot capture for visual proof
        ‚Ä¢ HAR file generation for network traffic
        ‚Ä¢ DOM snapshots for client-side evidence
        ‚Ä¢ Automated reproduction script generation

        Each phase builds upon the previous one to create a comprehensive security assessment.

      title: "Advanced URL Workflow Concepts",
      content: `
        **ROI Algorithm and URL Selection**
        The workflow uses a sophisticated ROI algorithm to prioritize URLs based on:
        ‚Ä¢ Technology stack complexity (higher score for dynamic applications)
        ‚Ä¢ Input parameters and forms (more attack vectors = higher priority)
        ‚Ä¢ Authentication requirements (protected resources are higher value)
        ‚Ä¢ Response characteristics (larger responses may indicate functionality)

        **Deduplication and Finding Management**
        ‚Ä¢ Uses SHA256 key hashing for intelligent deduplication
        ‚Ä¢ Groups similar findings across different URLs
        ‚Ä¢ Tracks findings across multiple testing contexts
        ‚Ä¢ Maintains finding lifecycle from discovery to resolution

        **Two-Stage Detection System**
        ‚Ä¢ Stage 1: Signal Detection - Fast identification of potential issues
        ‚Ä¢ Stage 2: Browser Validation - Confirms vulnerabilities in real browser environment
        ‚Ä¢ Reduces false positives while maintaining comprehensive coverage

        **Multi-Identity Testing**
        ‚Ä¢ Tests as unauthenticated user
        ‚Ä¢ Tests with low-privilege accounts
        ‚Ä¢ Tests for privilege escalation opportunities
        ‚Ä¢ Tests for cross-tenant data access

        **Out-of-Band (OOB) Interaction**
        ‚Ä¢ Detects blind vulnerabilities (SSRF, XXE, etc.)
        ‚Ä¢ Uses dedicated DNS and HTTP servers for interaction callbacks
        ‚Ä¢ Correlates OOB events with specific test payloads
        ‚Ä¢ Provides proof of exploitation for blind vulnerabilities

        **Kill Chain Analysis**
        ‚Ä¢ Identifies vulnerability chains for complex attacks
        ‚Ä¢ Maps attack paths from initial access to impact
        ‚Ä¢ Prioritizes findings based on exploitability
        ‚Ä¢ Generates comprehensive attack scenarios
