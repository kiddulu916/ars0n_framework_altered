**Testing Framework**: React Testing Library + Jest for component testing

### Step 2.2: Workflow Orchestration Engine
**Objective**: Advanced workflow management with conditional logic and dependencies.

**Implementation Tasks**:
- Design workflow definition language (YAML-based)
- Implement workflow engine with step dependencies
- Add conditional branching based on scan results
- Create workflow templates for common use cases
- Implement workflow rollback and recovery mechanisms

**Testing Framework**: Go testing package + Testify for unit and integration tests

## Phase 3: Advanced Security & Intelligence

### Step 3.1: Machine Learning Enhanced Prioritization

**Objective**: AI-driven vulnerability prioritization and false positive reduction.

**Implementation Tasks**:

- Implement ML model for vulnerability scoring (T5-small)
- Create training pipeline for custom models
- Add historical data analysis for pattern recognition
- Implement automated triage recommendations
- Create feedback loop for model improvement

**Testing Framework**: Python pytest for ML model validation

### Step 3.2: Advanced OSINT Integration

**Objective**: Enhanced intelligence gathering and correlation.

**Implementation Tasks**:

- Integrate additional OSINT data sources (VirusTotal, etc.)
- Implement data correlation engine
- Add threat intelligence feeds integration
- Create automated IOC detection and alerting
- Implement social media monitoring capabilities

**Testing Framework**: Go testing + Mock HTTP servers for external API testing

### Step 3.3: Custom Rule Engine

**Objective**: User-defined detection rules and custom workflows.

**Implementation Tasks**:

- Design rule definition language (similar to Sigma/YARA)
- Implement rule engine for custom detection logic
- Add rule marketplace and sharing capabilities
- Create rule testing and validation framework
- Implement rule performance optimization

**Testing Framework**: Go testing + Rule engine test harness

## Testing Strategy for New Features

### **Go Backend Testing**

- **Framework**: Go standard testing package + Testify
- **Coverage**: Unit tests for all new functions, integration tests for API endpoints
- **Database Testing**: Docker test containers with PostgreSQL
- **External API Testing**: HTTP mocking libraries

### **React Frontend Testing**

- **Framework**: React Testing Library + Jest
- **Coverage**: Component tests, user interaction tests
- **E2E Testing**: Playwright for critical user journeys
- **Visual Testing**: Chromatic for UI regression testing

### **Python AI Service Testing**

- **Framework**: pytest + FastAPI TestClient
- **Coverage**: Model validation, API endpoint testing
- **ML Testing**: Model performance benchmarks and accuracy tests

### **Integration Testing**

- **Framework**: Docker Compose test environments
- **Coverage**: Service-to-service communication, workflow testing
- **Performance Testing**: Load testing with k6 or Artillery

## Implementation Priorities

### **Phase 2 Priority Order**:

1. Advanced Reporting Dashboard (High business value)
2. Workflow Orchestration Engine (Foundation for automation)

### **Phase 3 Priority Order**:

1. Custom Rule Engine (Extensibility)
2. ML Enhanced Prioritization (Intelligence)
3. Advanced OSINT Integration (Data richness)

Each phase builds upon the previous, ensuring a stable progression while maintaining the system's core philosophy of "Earn While You Learn.
